Solving Color-Maze Puzzle Using Search

## Getting Started

To solve the Color-Maze Puzzle, you can either use the provided `Maze.txt` or create your own maze. 

### Maze Format

Here's what each character in the maze file represents:

- `X`: Walls. These are barriers and cannot be passed.
- `S`: Our agent. This is the starting point in the maze.
- `0`: Empty places that need to be colored. When these are collected, they will turn into `1`s.

### Example

XXXXX
XS0XX
X0X0X
X0XXX
XXXXX


This represents a small maze where the agent `S` needs to collect the `0`s and turn them into `1`s.
